============

This package is a simple command-line interface wrapper around the
[`FarmerInterface`](http://storj.github.io/core/FarmerInterface.html) class
from [StorjCORE](https://github.com/storj/core). As such, it's very likely that
bug reports should be opened there. As a general rule:

* If you experience an issue with network connectivity, unexpected crashes, and
  similar, [open an issue here](https://github.com/storj/core/issues).
* If you find a problem related to the first run wizard, configuration issues,
  and similar, [open and issue here](https://github.com/storj/farmer/issues).
